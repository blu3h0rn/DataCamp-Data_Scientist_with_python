'''In the recent lesson, we learned that Seaborn plot functions create two different types of objects: FacetGrid objects and AxesSubplot objects. The method for adding a title to your plot will differ depending on the type of object it is.

In the code provided, we've used relplot() with the miles per gallon dataset to create a scatter plot showing the relationship between a car's weight and its horsepower. This scatter plot is assigned to the variable name g. Let's identify which type of object it is.

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
'''

# Create scatter plot
g = sns.relplot(x="weight",
                y="horsepower",
                data=mpg,
                kind="scatter")

# Identify plot type
type_of_g = type(g)

# Print type
print(type_of_g)
